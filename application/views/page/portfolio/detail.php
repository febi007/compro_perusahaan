				<p class="bk_pra wow move-up">While some websites are simple and any
					luddite can
					quickly build them with existing DIY tools, many business websites are
					extremely complex and are custom built by internal teams and / or
					digital agencies for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Or millions.
					And, many small businesses just don’t want to learn how to use DIY
					tools, or don’t care to, or have time to. They’d rather focus on their
					day to day business. Digital marketing is not their forte or interest.
